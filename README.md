License verification is done via `TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider` (C#) with Passphrase. Decompiling the program and looking for `passphrase` you find it unencrypted. Nothing could be simpler ;)

You can found the keygen code in [keygen.cs](keygen.cs).

In case the programs are updated, [here](Setup/) you will find the old crackable setups.
